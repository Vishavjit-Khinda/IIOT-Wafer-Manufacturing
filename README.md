# Smart Semiconductor Manufacturing Using IIoT Architecture

##  Project Summary

This project implements an **Industrial IoT system** for semiconductor wafer manufacturing to detect defects in real-time before expensive downstream processing and inspection. The system uses a **5-layer IIoT architecture** with edge-based machine learning (XGBoost) to predict wafer defects with:

- **79.8% Recall** - Catches 67 out of 84 defects
- **69.8% Precision** - 70% of alarms are real defects  
- **<50ms Latency** - Real-time edge inference

By this IIOT approach, we are able to predict bad wafer much before the inspection and downstream stage, ultimately leading to savings in terms of money, resources and manual labour.

The solution demonstrates end-to-end data flow from sensor simulation → MQTT messaging → edge ML inference → cloud storage (PostgreSQL) → real-time monitoring dashboard.

**Technologies:** `Python` `MQTT` `XGBoost` `PostgreSQL` `Streamlit` `Edge Computing`

### Confusion Matrix

|  | **Predicted: No Defect** | **Predicted: Defect** |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| **Actual: No Defect** | 731 (TN) | 29 (FP) |
| **Actual: Defect** | 17 (FN) | 67 (TP) |

- ✅ **True Positives (TP):** 67 - Defects Caught

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PostgreSQL 13 or higher
- MQTT Broker (HiveMQ)

### Installation

#### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vishavjit-Khinda/IIOT-Wafer-Manufacturing.git
cd IIOT-Wafer-Manufacturing
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost paho-mqtt psycopg2-binary streamlit plotly
```


#### 3. Setup PostgreSQL Database

Create database:

```
In Run Query window
Paste query from database.txt
```


#### 4. Configure Credentials

Update **both files** with your PostgreSQL password:

**`edge_gateway.py` (line 15):**

```python
DB_CONFIG = {
    'host': 'localhost',
    'port': 5432,
    'database': 'Your database name',     # ← change this
    'user': 'postgres',
    'password': 'Your database password'  # ← Change this
}
```

**`dashboard.py` (line 30):**

```python
DB_CONFIG = {
    'host': 'localhost',
    'port': 5432,
    'database': 'Your database name',     # ← Change this
    'user': 'postgres',
    'password': 'Your database password'  # ← Change this
}
```

Configure MQTT in **both** `device_publisher.py` and `edge_gateway.py`:

```python
MQTT_BROKER = "your-broker.hivemq.cloud"
MQTT_PORT = 8883
MQTT_USERNAME = "your_username"
MQTT_PASSWORD = "your_password"
```


##  How to Run

Make sure database is setup and connected.

### Run the System (3 Terminals Required)

#### Terminal 1: Start Edge Gateway

```bash
python edge_gateway.py
```

**Output:**
```
Connected to MQTT Broker
Subscribed to topic: factory/line1/lithography
Subscribed to topic: factory/line2/etching
Subscribed to topic: factory/line3/deposition
Waiting for sensor data...
```

#### Terminal 2: Start Sensor Simulator

```bash
python device_publisher.py
```

**Output:**
```
Connected to MQTT Broker
Publishing to factory/line1/lithography
Published: {"wafer_id": "WAF12345"}
Publishing to factory/line2/etching
Published: {"wafer_id": "WAF67890"}
```

#### Terminal 3: Start Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

**Output:**
```
You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

## 💰 Business Value (Rough Estimate)

### Cost Savings Analysis
  With the help of IIOT architecture and edge ML prediction, bad wafer is predicted through process parameters before the inspection takes place, ultimately resulting savings in terms of inspection cost.

**Assumptions:**
- Factory processes 10,000 wafers/month
- Defect rate: 10% (1,000 defects/month)
- Optical inspection cost: $5 per wafer
- Our ML Model recall: 79.8%

| Scenario | Calculation | Cost |
|:---------|:------------|:-----|
| **Without IIoT** | 1,000 defects × $5 | $5,000/month |
| **With IIoT - Savings** | 798 defects caught × $5 | $3,990/month |
| **With IIoT - False Alarms** | 300 false alarms × $5 | $1,500/month |
| **Net Savings** | $3,990 - $1,500 | **$2,490/month** |

**Annual ROI: $30,000**
